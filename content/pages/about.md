## About Me

> I don't run very fast but I can run pretty far

My running career started in 2009 when I completed my first Bank of America Chicago Marathon. 10 years later and I've completed over 25 marathons with most of them across the Midwest.

Most people probably see that marathon count and think _that guy really really likes to run_. Part of that is definitely true, but I still insist that I'm not crazy about the physical activity of running.  It's not a particularly well-rounded workout, requires a lot of time to get good at and as I mentioned earlier, I'm not a very fast runner. However, one thing I do love about running is the exploration it enables.

I find that there is a very particular sense of triumph when you can go to a new city, environment, park or trail and then explore it in detail on your own two feet. No one has to run to do this, but the further you run the more you see.

As a Chicagoan, I'm lucky to live in a city which such high explorability between its diverse neighborhoods, lakefront, and numerous parks. It's not a coincidence that I've ran its marathon 10 times.
