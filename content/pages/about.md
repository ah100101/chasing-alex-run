## About Me

> I don't run very fast but I can run pretty far

My running career started in 2009 when I completed my first Bank of America Chicago Marathon. 10 years later and I've completed over 25 marathons with most of them across the Midwest.

Most people probably see that marathon count and think _that guy really really likes to run_. Part of that is definitely true, but I still insist that I'm not crazy about the physical activity of running.  It's not a particularly well-rounded workout, requires a lot of time to get good at and as I mentioned earlier, I'm not a very fast runner. However, one thing I do love about running is the exploration it enables.

I find that there is a very particular sense of triumph when you can go to a new city, environment, park or trail and then explore it in detail on your own two feet. No one has to run to do this, but the further you run the more you see.

As a native Chicagoan I'm lucky to be able to explore this beautiful city on my own two feet. I've ran its marathon the last 10 years and I hope to use this site as a way to document those future marathons and any other events that tap into this form of exploration.
