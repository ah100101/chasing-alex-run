> I don't run very fast but I can run pretty far

![](/images/about-photo-1.jpg)

My running career started in 2009 when I completed my first Bank of America Chicago Marathon. 10 years later and I've completed over 25 marathons with most of them across the Midwest.

Most people probably see that marathon count and think _that guy really really likes to run_. Part of that is definitely true, but I still insist that I'm not crazy about the physical activity of running.  It's not a particularly well-rounded workout, requires a lot of time to get good at and as I mentioned earlier, I'm not a very fast runner. However, one thing I do love about running is the exploration it enables.

I find that there is a very particular sense of triumph when you can go to a new city, environment, park or trail and then explore it in detail on your own two feet. No one has to run to do this, but the further you run the more you see.

As a Chicagoan, I'm lucky to live in a city which such high explorability between its diverse neighborhoods, lakefront, and numerous parks. It's not a coincidence that I've ran its marathon 10 times.

## About this site

This site serves 2 purposes

1. Hold me accountable

   I've found that a good way to make sure I do something is to tell a bunch of other people that I'm doing something.
2. Catalog future marathons and other endurance events

   _Run_ may be part of the domain and title but I expect many other types of activities to be covered here.

   My also hope for this site to generate discussion around particular endurance events and the training / preparation required for them.

### #NerdAlert

When I'm not running - I'm usually building websites.

6 years ago I had a running blog on a cookie cutter Wordpress site for when I ran 12 marathons in a year. Never again.

...to having a boring vanilla blog

This site was built from the ground up by me. More specifically, it's built on

![Nuxt.js logo](https://nuxtjs.org/logos/nuxtjs-typo.svg "Nuxt.js")

which is an open source Vue.js framework for creating awesome websites and applications. Nuxt.js is also great for generating static websites which pairs nicely with

![](https://www.netlify.com/img/press/logos/full-logo-light.png)

for static site hosting (websites that are just html, javascript, and css). Netlify does much more than just static site hosting, but for this blog it seamlessly builds and deploys my code updates to the live site without making me jump through any hoops, for free. 

Static sites are worth very much if you can't update them with new content which is where [Forestry](https://forestry.io "Forestry.io") comes in.![Forestry.io logo](/images/forestry.jpg "Forestry")Forestry is a CMS that _commits_ its content through a repository instead of through a database.
