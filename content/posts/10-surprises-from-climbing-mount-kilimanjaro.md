I'll admit, it has been difficult putting together a summary of the Kilimanjaro climb. There were so many things that happened on the eight day hike. I need at least ten posts to approach accurately depicting the experience. I debated making this post about my exercise metrics that I recorded during every day of the hike or a day-by-day analysis of how challenging every leg of the hike was. Honestly, both didn't seem particularly interesting to write about.

However, when discussing the trek with others, I find that I talk mostly about the surprises on the mountain that did not quite align with my research prior to the trip. Instead of a summary for this post, I'll be summarizing ten experiences, decisions or animals that completed surprised me when climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.

Granted, there were many breathtaking views and amazing encounters on the climb (e.g. Barranco Wall, first views of the summit, the great food, reaching the summit, jungle wild life) that I won't detail here. Those items are called out in countless other blogs and our group knew a lot of high points to anticipate. Having said all that, there were many surprises I could have planned better for and many situations I could have worried about less.

#### 1. Sleeping in (sometimes) freezing temperatures at night isn't that rough

Full disclosure - I've never been camping prior to climbing Kilimanjaro, so a few surprises were bound to happen when living in a tent for eight days. I was expecting some truly miserable sleepless nights once temps began dropping as we got higher up the mountain. I joked about sleeping on my balcony in a sleeping bag, in Chicago, to prepare for the cold. While it did take a few minutes each night to muster the mental strength to get out the sleeping bags, falling asleep each night and staying asleep wasn't really an issue for me. I should note that our group did do a fair amount of research into the sleeping bags that Pristine Trails, our tour company, carried and we knew we were going to be renting high quality bags.

#### 2. I roasted in our tent the day before summit night

I spent a lot of time prior to the trip trying to plan around cold temperatures, I never expected that the temperatures would fluctuate between hot and cold as frequently as it did. Specifically, I thought it was going to be non-stop cold at base camp (\~15,000 feet). Unfortunately, when the sun came out, it turned the inside of the tent into a furnace and it was impossible not the sweat, even with considerable winds going through camp.

#### 3. Mice at base camp

Naturally, when I was stuck sweating in the tent trying to rest for summit night, the first idea was to open the tent and get a cross breeze. Unfortunately, mice are all over Barafu Camp (and many of the other camps) and will jump into your tent if you leave it open for them.

#### 4. There really isn't that much downtime

Eight days is a lot of time. It's particularly a lot of time when you're not going to have access to internet. We brought a few card games and I considered bringing more than one book. I didn't touch the one book I did bring and I think our group played cards three or four times for an hour or two max. Even though we didn't cover a ton of mileage during the hikes, by the time we got to camp we were usually exhausted and ready to sleep. The daily schedule ran something like:

* 4 - 5 am - Summon mental willpower to get out of your sleeping bag
* 6 am - Coffee and breakfast
* 7 am: Hike starts
* 1 - 3 pm: Arrival at next camp (time fluctuated depending on hike distance and difficulty)
* 3 - 5 pm: Nap for a couple hours
* 5 - 6 pm: Mission brief and vital readings for the next day
* 6 - 8 pm: Dinner and hang out (maybe?)
* 8 - 10 pm: Sleep

These were very full days and when there was free time I usually wanted to crash instead of hanging out or reading.

#### 5. The summit climb is cold, but it wasn't four socks and four jackets cold

The image I had of base camp was much different than the reality. My initial image didn't include snow but I thought it was going to be very cold. While it was chilly at times during the day, we still had plenty of sun and it wasn't close to freezing at all. My itemized list of daily gear prepped for the situation where I needed four pairs of socks and four jackets for the summit climb. I ended up wearing two pairs of socks (a mountaineering sock and a liner) and I started the climb with two jackets (down coat and a rain hard-shell). I was sweating at the very start of the climb and didn't need my gloves until we were an hour into the climb.

Everyone's different, and I tend to run on the warmer side of the spectrum, so I don't expect I'm the norm in this situation. I was also glad to have all of that gear when we reached Stella Point and marched to the Uhuru Peak where it felt substantially colder.

#### 6. I over-packed

I shouldn't be shocked by this one. Kilimanjaro was my first time climbing a mountain, first time camping and the first time in Africa. For the eight day hike I packed 81 individual items, including:

* 8 running shirts
* 2 different sets of a gaiters
* 4 different types of water bottles
* 5 different types of hats / scarves
* Trail runners that I wore a single day
* 4 shirts just for hanging out at camp
* 12 pairs of socks (I still don't understand how I rationalized that as OK)
* 5 different types of jackets

I probably could have cut some of these numbers at least in half. I brought _hundreds_ of water purification tablets that I never used or even came close to needing (better safe than sorry, I guess). I never really needed trail running shoes for the hike and would have traded them for flip flops if I followed any of the numerous blogs that said flip flops were useful. Generally, I was glad I had more gear than I needed, but I had far beyond enough items in some categories.

#### 7. A small group worked out better than expected

Our group researched Kilimanjaro Trek companies for several months before booking one. We decided to leave the group as the 5 of us and not join a larger group of hikers. Leading up to the trip many of us had wished that we had joined a larger group, knowing that it would be more interesting to talk to others that were also climbing the highest point in Africa. By the end of second or third day our tune had changed and we couldn't have been happier with our smaller private group. We were very close with our guides and porters and learned a lot about their lives leading people to the top of Kilimanjaro. All of our meals and gatherings were always accompanied by laughter, stories and insight into life around the mountain. I do not doubt that if we went with a larger group it would have still been rewarding, but I would never trade what our experience was in our small group.

#### 8. Heading down the mountain in a day is rough

When I did research for Kilimanjaro, I probably spent less than 30 seconds thinking about and planning for the hike down from the summit. It's seven days up and one day down, how bad could the last section be? Pretty bad.

After reaching the summit, it took _several hours_ to get back to base camp and _another_ 1.5 - 2 hours to get to the final camp for the day and get some rest. To say "you're exhausted" by the end of the summit day is an understatement.

#### 9. I ate way more than expected

Spending 4 - 5 hours a day on your feet for more than a week requires fuel and I suspect that isn't a surprise to anyone. However, when you're heading into high altitude you may lose appetite. One goal I had to help me feel "good" on these hikes was to make sure I ate anything that was put in front of my face, in addition to drinking at least 4 liters of water a day. Every day I waited for the nausea to hit me or for my appetite to be curbed, but it never happened. Our group's inside joke at dinner each night was to take a second helping of food "for the mission". I ate so much, that it's questionable if I really needed to bring half the snacks that I did.

#### 10. The summit climb was TOUGH

I'm writing this post from a comfortable couch and the air conditioning is on. I don't _truly remember_ how miserable that summit climb was. Just like marathon running, the body forgets pain shortly after it subsides. I read countless articles stating how tough the summit climb was and how it's the toughest thing you'll ever do. I never actually understood how rough it was until we were in the middle of it.

As a marathoner, of course I tried to draw some kind of simplified comparison of the summit hike to running an endurance race. Nothing effective came to mind for months. Now that it has been nearly five months since the trek I am able to make some comparisons, probably because I don't remember the agony quite as vividly:

Take a running distance you wouldn't be comfortable doing and a race where your battery would be 1% at the end. Let's say that's a marathon. The summit day / night is like running a marathon in one direction, except at the end, you have to walk all the way back through the exact same course to get home.

It's like running a marathon, only if you stop to catch your breath - you don't actually catch your breath.

When running a marathon, anything can happen after mile 18 and derail your race. Your body can run out of fuel, have intense nausea or begin suffering from an overuse injury. From mile 18 until the finish line, you wonder if you're going to finish or hit your goal. The entire summit night felt like that.

The push to the summit started around midnight and it took us over _seven and a half hours_ to reach it (we needed an additional 3 hours to get back to base-camp). The cold and altitude was tough, but we also had to fight through horribly intense winds and dust to get to the top. We couldn't hear anything because of the wind. Even though we had headlamps, we really couldn't see anything because our heads were pointed down to avoid sand hitting our eyes. Half way up, there was a hiker being lead down because they could no longer see. The most surreal moment, maybe of my life, was being about half way there and our lead guide asking us if we wanted tea. We all agreed. The five of us sat there, at \~17,000 feet, in the dark, in what seemed like a sand hurricane, sipping tea as people fought up the mountain alongside us. We were instructed not to ask the guides "how much longer" because it was never going to be a good answer. If we looked up the mountain there always seemed to be an endless string of lights heading up the mountain with no end in sight. I knew that the goal was to be at Stella Point (\~45 min from the summit) when the sun comes up. I found myself not looking up the mountain to gauge our progress, but looking at the horizon for the first glimpse of daylight. Eventually the daylight did arrive.

Everything changed after hitting Stella Point. The sun came out and we also found ourselves in the ice and snow on top of the mountain and were hiking at a much flatter incline to Uhuru Peak.

Our group was very fortunate and all of us made it to the summit without any health issues. We had a stellar group of guides and porters from Pristine Trails \[link\] that guided us safely and successfully to the summit. The positive experience I associate with Kilimanjaro is tightly associated with the crew that Pristine Trails provided. They kept us laughing the entire way up the mountain and made sure that we were safe every day.
