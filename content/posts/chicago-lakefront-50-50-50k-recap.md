Five days before this race, out of the curiosity, I looked up a training plan for a 50k starting from zero miles. This was a mistake. The result did not fill me with confidence and I thought an overuse injury was likely at some point after 20 miles during this 50k. Fortunately, my suspicion was incorrect and some of my strongest miles were toward the end.

The Lakefront 50k was a very familiar route since it starts near Montrose Harbor and runs south to North Avenue Beach. Between training runs and other races the last few years I've probably ran the course up there a few dozen times. The course for the 50k was a round trip between Foster Ave Beach and North Avenue three times with aid stations on both sides of the course and half way between.

Low key, I ran this race mostly for the food. I've been hearing about ultra aid stations for a quite a while now and I wasn't disappointed. There were cookies, chips, pretzels, peanuts, cashews, Doritos, tortillas, PB&J, Coca Cola, Mountain Dew, Tailwind, and Pumpkin Pie. Maybe it was coincidental timing but after I had a slice of the pie at mile 20, that seemed to kick start a third wind.

As I mentioned in the preview, I hoped to finish under 6 hours and remain uninjured. I tried to stay around a 120 BPM and aimed for a 10 min / mile pace for as long as I could. Generally, I wasn't very strict about holding myself to these numbers and just wanted to be sure I was running slower than usual for a long run.

My final average BPM was higher at 139 but with a 10:10 min / mile average moving pace. Around mile 24 I was doubting my chances at hitting a sub 6 hour time but was happily surprised when my legs seemed to be feeling fresh again at mile 26. Of my seven fastest miles of 32, four of them were after mile 27 which was the biggest surprise of the race.

Until this race, I've thought that running a marathon was just like using a battery. The battery depleting to 0% faster or slower depending on the quality of my nutrition, training, and my hydration. Rarely, if ever, have I been able to completely halt or recharge while on the run. My working theory is that the surplus of food carried me further than I usually do. Specifically, the slice of pumpkin pie and the Coca Cola fueled me out of a significant low at mile 20.

My legs and body were definitely toast at the end when I finished in 5:53:47, but I think I could have gone a little further if I needed to. I haven't decided yet if I have graduated past 32 miles for an ultra yet, but since I finished with my legs feeling almost fresh, I'm hopeful that I'll have longer race in the future.
