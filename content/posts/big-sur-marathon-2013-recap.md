description: The recap for the marathon that trades speed for hill work and spectators
  for scenery

body: "I can't even describe how much I wanted to hate this marathon. The 3:45 am
  shuttle time, being crammed in a bus for an hour to get to the starting line, standing
  around for another hour waiting for the gun to go off, climbing the hills, going
  down the hills, climbing the hills, thinking that you're at the top of the hill,
  climbing higher, then higher, and still higher. This marathon had pain roaring down
  every hill and agony rolling around every bend. I really wanted to hate this marathon
  for all of this, but this is what marathon running is all about!\n\nThe course of
  Big Sur is definitely unique. It takes off down California's coastal and scenic
  Highway 1, starting in the forests near Big Sur, and finishing in Carmel, CA. It's
  a point to point marathon, with peak elevation around mile 12. I have never done
  a point to point marathon, nor a marathon where you could turn around and see where
  you were six miles prior. Both gave a unique perspective on the distance that's
  actually covered during a marathon. Also, I'm not aware of any regular marathon
  that has hills comparable to Big Sur. For some perspective, below is the elevation
  chart for the Chicago Marathon. Chicago is basically flat as a pancake, with the
  overpass at Roosevelt Road being one of the biggest climbs in elevation:\n\n[![ChicagoElevationChart](http://alexalwaysrunning.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/chicagoelevationchart.png
  =620x194)](http://alexalwaysrunning.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/chicagoelevationchart.png)By
  comparison, this is Big Sur (note that the y-axis scaling is also greater):\n\n[![BigSurElevation](http://alexalwaysrunning.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bigsurelevation.png
  =623x200)](http://alexalwaysrunning.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bigsurelevation.png)The
  mile 10 to 12 stretch, a climb from near sea level to \"Hurricane Point\", is nothing
  to play around with. Actually, for the most part, none of these peaks were anything
  to play around with.\n\nAs difficult as the hills are, there is an advantage that
  the course provides that is absent from all other marathons:\n\nWords and pictures
  can't do justice to the scenery. The only way to accurately depict the landscape
  is to take someone there and show them. On several occasions I heard discussions
  between veterans of the race, where they commented about the unbelievable scenery,
  including a brief conversation with woman who was running her 21st consecutive Big
  Sur marathon, and still couldn't believe the blue color of the Pacific Ocean. I
  knew that the scenery was going to steal the show going into the race, but it far
  exceeded my expectations.\n\nDespite knowing that the scenery was the focus of the
  marathon, there was a great amount of stress I was carrying into the race. The runner's
  knee in my left leg was still recovering from the March marathon, and spiked in
  two weeks prior to Big Sur. As a result, I took off basically all athletic activity
  for the two weeks leading up to this. I know there are some people who think I have
  a pretty inaccurate definition of \"taking a day off\", but with the exception of
  one modified WOD and jogging a quarter mile the night before the race, I did nothing
  to stress my legs for this marathon. As difficult as it is to describe the landscape
  at Big Sur, it's just as difficult to describe how frustrating it was to sit around
  and do nothing for those two weeks.\n\nFortunately, my left knee didn't explode
  all over Highway 1 and the two weeks proved to be good enough to knock out the 26.2
  miles. It wasn't until just after 13 miles that the runner's knee starting surfacing
  again. Interestingly, my knee felt fine during the uphill portions of the race,
  and not so much going downhill. If it wasn't already, this amplified the love-hate
  relationship with the course. I would look forward to the uphill portions because
  of the relief to my knee, but would hate it for setting my quads and ankles on fire.
  Similarly, going downhill was awesome for the relief from climbing, but then terrible
  as soon as my knee started protesting.\n\nEven if we were running in the middle
  of nowhere with nothing to look at, the hills would have been entertaining on their
  own. As I told one marathoner \"We don't have hills in Chicago and our roads don't
  curve either. We run in straight lines and in one direction.\" I completed exactly
  0.0 miles of \"hill work\" in preparation. Definitely overconfident from doing CrossFit
  and it being my 13th marathon. I wouldn't say that the hills were much tougher than
  I was expecting, but it was definitely Hell in several areas. The two mile climb
  to \"Hurricane Point\", the apex of the course, gets special recognition. By mile
  26, I'm fairly certain there wasn't a single cell in my body that wasn't on fire
  and screaming in protest.\n\n  \n[![At the finish.  Looking better than I felt.](http://alexalwaysrunning.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/730562-1099-0040s.jpg

  the organization of the race, Big Sur was handled very well. Aside from closing
  off most of Highway 1 and providing the standard aid stations every couple miles,
  there were multiple bands and a piano player at the Bixby bridge to keep things
  moving down the highway. It was pretty incredible to hear the piano at least three
  miles away on Hurricane Peak. Normally, I would say that these things don't matter
  to me, but 99% of the course was closed off to spectators so any extra commotion
  was a good thing.\n\n  \n[![Finished!](http://alexalwaysrunning.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/730543-1022-0018s.jpg

  knew long before I finished Big Sur, that this was definitely a new high point for
  my running career, despite it being my slowest marathon. It was definitely my toughest
  marathon to date, and with my legs being less than 100% it was more of a challenge
  than I could have asked for. Ideally, I'll be running this race again next year,
  but its increasing popularity might make registration impossible.\n\nAny marathon
  following this one has a lot to live up to. Fortunately, there are two and a Tough
  Mudder this month to pick up the slack!"

> I wanted to hate this marathon.

I had runner's knee. I woke up at 2:30 am for a 3:45 am shuttle. I was crammed on a bus for an hour to get to the starting line. I stood for another hour and a half at the starting line waiting for the gun to go off. I climbed and descended endless hills. This marathon had pain around every literal corner.

These are the prices you pay to run the Big Sur Marathon, but the views and experience are worth it.

Big Sur's course is unique. It travels north on California's coastal and scenic Highway 1 and starts in the forests near Big Sur and finishes in Carmel, CA. It's a point-to-point marathon with peak elevation around mile 12.

I have never completed a point-to point-marathon or a marathon where you can turn around and see where you were six miles earlier. Both provided a unique perspective on the distance that's actually covered during a marathon.

I know there are many marathons with more frequent and taller hills but this course was like nothing I have completed. For perspective, below is the elevation chart for the Chicago Marathon. Chicago is so flat that the overpass at Roosevelt Road is one of the biggest climbs in elevation:

Here is Big Sur (note that the y-axis scale is greater as well):

![Charting showing the elevation of the Big Sur Marathon](/images/big-sur-elevation.jpg "Big Sur Elevation Chart")

The mile 10 to 12 stretch, a climb from near sea level to Hurricane Point, is obviously the most challenging climb on the course.

As difficult as the hills are, there is an advantage that the course provides that is absent from all other marathons:

Words and pictures don't do justice to the scenery. You have to be there. On several occasions I overheard veteran runners of the race commenting about the unbelievable scenery, including a brief conversation with woman who was running her 21st consecutive Big Sur Marathon, and she still couldn't believe the blue color of the Pacific Ocean. I knew that the scenery was going to steal the show, but it far exceeded my expectations.

Despite knowing that the scenery was the focus of the marathon, there was some stress going into the race. The runner's knee in my left leg was recovering from the March marathon, which had spiked two weeks prior to Big Sur. I took off almost all athletic activity for the two weeks leading up to this.

Even if we were running in the middle of nowhere with nothing to look at, the hills would have been entertaining on their own by offering a challenge I'm not used to. I completed exactly 0.0 miles of hill training in preparation. I was definitely overconfident with this being my 13th marathon. The two mile climb to Hurricane Point, the apex of the course, was certainly the toughest two miles of any race I've done.

The Big Sur Marathon was organized very well. Aside from closing off most of Highway 1 and providing the standard aid stations every couple miles, there were multiple bands and a piano player at Bixby Bridge to help keep things moving down the highway. It was pretty incredible to hear the piano when you are at least three miles away on Hurricane Peak. Normally, I would say that these things don't matter much during a large marathon, but 99% of the course was closed off to spectators so any extra commotion was welcome.

I knew long before I finished Big Sur, that this was definitely a new high point for my running career, despite it being probably my slowest marathon. It was definitely my toughest marathon to date. Hopefully, I'll be taking up this challenge again.
