> I wanted to hate this marathon.

I had runner's knee. I woke up at 2:30 am for a 3:45 am shuttle. I was crammed on a bus for an hour to get to the starting line. I stood for another hour and a half at the starting line waiting for the gun to go off. I climbed and descended endless hills. This marathon had pain around every literal corner.

These are the prices you pay to run the Big Sur Marathon, but the views and experience are worth it.

Big Sur's course is unique. It goes down California's coastal and scenic Highway 1 and starts in the forests near Big Sur and finishes in Carmel, CA. It's a point-to-point marathon with peak elevation around mile 12.

I have never completed a point-to point-marathon, nor a marathon where you can turn around and see where you were six miles earlier. Both provided a unique perspective on the distance that's actually covered during a marathon.

I know there are many marathons with more frequent and taller hills but this course was like nothing I completed before. For perspective, below is the elevation chart for the Chicago Marathon. Chicago is so flat that the overpass at Roosevelt Road is one of the biggest climbs in elevation:

Here is Big Sur (note that the y-axis scale is greater as well):

The mile 10 to 12 stretch, a climb from near sea level to Hurricane Point, is obviously the most challenging climb on the course.

As difficult as the hills are, there is an advantage that the course provides that is absent from all other marathons:

Words and pictures don't do justice to the scenery. The only way to accurately see the landscape is to physically be there. On several occasions I overheard veteran runners of the race commenting about the unbelievable scenery, including a brief conversation with woman who was running her 21st consecutive Big Sur Marathon, and she still couldn't believe the blue color of the Pacific Ocean. I knew that the scenery was going to steal the show going into the race, but it far exceeded my expectations.

Despite knowing that the scenery was the focus of the marathon, there was some stress going into the race. The runner's knee in my left leg was still recovering from the March marathon, and spiked two weeks prior to Big Sur. As a result, I took off basically all athletic activity for the two weeks leading up to this. I know there are some people who think I have a pretty inaccurate definition of "taking a day off", but with the exception of one modified workout and jogging a quarter mile the night before the race, I did nothing to stress my legs for this marathon. As difficult as it is to describe the landscape at Big Sur, it's just as difficult to describe how frustrating it was to sit around and do nothing for two weeks.

Fortunately, my left knee didn't explode all over Highway 1 and the two weeks proved to be good enough to knock out the 26.2 miles. It wasn't until just after 13 miles that the runner's knee starting surfacing again. Interestingly, my knee felt fine during the uphill portions of the race, and not so much going downhill. If it wasn't already, this amplified the love-hate relationship with the course. I would look forward to the uphill portions because of the relief to my knee, but would hate it for setting my quads and ankles on fire. Similarly, going downhill was awesome for the relief from climbing, but then terrible as soon as my knee started protesting.

Even if we were running in the middle of nowhere with nothing to look at, the hills would have been entertaining on their own by offering a challenge I'm not used to. I completed exactly 0.0 miles of hill training in preparation. I was definitely overconfident with this being my 13th marathon. The two mile climb to Hurricane Point, the apex of the course, was certainly the toughest two miles of any race I've done.

The Big Sur Marathon was organized very well. Aside from closing off most of Highway 1 and providing the standard aid stations every couple miles, there were multiple bands and a piano player at Bixby Bridge to help keep things moving down the highway. It was pretty incredible to hear the piano when you are at least three miles away on Hurricane Peak. Normally, I would say that these things don't matter much during a large marathon, but 99% of the course was closed off to spectators so any extra commotion was welcome

I knew long before I finished Big Sur, that this was definitely a new high point for my running career, despite it being probably my slowest marathon. It was definitely my toughest marathon to date. Hopefully, I'll be running this race again.
