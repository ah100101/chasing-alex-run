This year is the 20th Annual Chicago Lakefront 50/50 (50k and 50 miler) and I'll be running the 50k. The ultramarathon starts at Foster Avenue Beach and runs south down the lakefront to North Avenue Beach. From there runners head back to Foster Avenue Beach. The 50k does this \~10 mile loop 3 times and the 50 miler does a similar 12.5 mile loop 4 times. The course has a 7-hour time limit.

With over 10 years of running marathons, and never attempting an ultra, I think I'm due for one.

To be honest, I'm excited for the nostalgia at 26.21 miles when I can say "This is the _new_ longest distance I have ran" which I haven't said since 2009. Of course, there's also the fact that I'll be hopefully hitting both a time PR tomorrow for a 50k and an overall distance PR ðŸ˜ƒ

Unlike marathons, ultramarathons aren't tied to any specific distance. It only needs to be a race longer than 26.2 miles. There are ultras longer than 26.2 miles, 50 miles, 100 miles, and yes, even 200 miles. In comparison to many of these, a 31 mile 50k is probably one of the _easier_ (that's strange to say) ways to call myself an ultramarathoner. I should also note that the course is nearly completely flat. Nevertheless, standard marathons have given me plenty of problems in the past so I'm anxious to see what 31 miles throws my way.

The timing of this lakefront ultramarathon is pretty ideal with it being only 3 weeks after the Chicago Marathon and I've stayed in a race mindset. That said, it did take a bit longer to recover from Chicago than I would have liked, so an extra week for recovery would have been great. However, since the only goal is to finish uninjured, I'm not _too_ concerned.

I followed several metrics during the Chicago Marathon to gauge my performance, but I don't plan on using the same level of detail for the ultra. I'll be looking to keep my BPM between 110 and 120 (instead of 130 - 150) and I'm hoping to finish under 6 hours. Finishing uninjured is crucial since I have a Ragnar Relay 6 days after this race - so keeping a moderate pace and stopping when needed is going to be crucial.

I'm not crazy about the forecast in low 30s for the race, but I'm excited to see the atypical aid stations with TailWind, Coke, Mountain Dew, pickles, chips, pretzels, cookies and M&Ms. I'm not exactly sure what the personality is going to be for the ultra, but if my previous trail and winter marathons are any indicator, I think it's going to be a laid back fun experience.
