There have only been a couple marathons where I ran 100% according to a pre-established plan. My 2013 PR in Chicago and my first Christie Clinic Marathon were both races that I ran with a nearly constant pace and I knew I didn't leave anything on the course. I'm happy to say that I ran Chicago this year 90% according to plan with a couple minor deviations.

As detailed in [my preview last week](https://chasingalex.run/posts/2019-chicago-marathon/ "Preview") I set a couple minor goals to help me hit my overall goal of running a sub 4 hour marathon.

##### Run the first half slower than the second half

I want to emphasize that this goal is distinct from: "Run the second half _faster_ than the first half". It's important that I get to the 13.1 mile marker feeling like I still have a lot left in the tank. If I turn on the jets too early then it's very likely I'll have an uncomfortable second half. If / when something bad happens after mile 18 there aren't many options if I burned all the reserves.

##### Don't rely on GPS for pace

Running downtown is not great for GPS watches so I didn't want to rely on them for checking my pace. Instead, I made sure I hit my splits based on an absolute slowest 9 min/mile pace.

##### Keep an eye on BPM (specifically between 130 - 150)

This was a new metric for me. In previous races, I tried to gauge my performance based on how my legs "felt". This is very loose footing to stand on and has probably failed me as many times as it has succeeded. I knew that 9 min/mile put me comfortably around 140 BPM which was a second separate stat to gauge my performance.

As seen above, my pace for the entire race was 8:41 min/mile and I averaged 152 BPM. Both of these stats are a bit quicker than I would have liked and might help explain my extended leg soreness this week. However, I knew I was likely going to be under 9 min/mile for the race if it went well. Just not \~20 seconds faster.

My 5K splits show a similar story but also that I technically didn't make my first half slower than the second.

Again, it's clear that I was floating around 8:41 min/mile with some surges in the beginning and toward the end. However, my first half was done in 1:55:33 and my second half was slower than 1:57:00 so I can't quite check that first goal off the list. 

While the overall race went well, there were a couple moments after the half where it was clear that the "comfortable" pace was not going to cut it for sub 4 hours. Miles 18, 19 and 20 were my slowest on the course with average paces of 9:30, 9:21, and 9:15. After seeing my 3rd consecutive 9+ min/mile pace at mile 21 the math was looking tight for getting under 4 hours unless I was ready to make the remaining miles on the course pretty miserable. The grind to the finish started at mile 21 as I followed up with 8:33 (mile 21), 8:46 (mile 22), 8:49 (mile 23), 8:38 (mile 24) and 8:03 (mile 25). So while the second half was slower than the first, I was happy with putting up some decently quick miles at the end.

Obviously, there is more than 5K splits and my average heart rate to the marathon. The marathon continues to be one of my favorite days of the year, particularly when the weather cooperates. Fortunately, Chicago showed up this year with great running temperatures and blue skies.

The temperature in Grant Park at the start was in the low 40s. This is great for running but not so much for standing around and waiting. Every cold Chicago marathon has been bad for my feet before the start. Running shoes don't have much insulation and this year I was running with a very minimal pair of barefoot shoes. Having cold bricks for feet is no good so I had plastic bags on both feet in addition to a large poncho insulating the rest of my body until the corral started moving - an awkward way to start a race.

I believe this was the furthest back in the race I have ever been (Corral G) and I felt like I spent more time than usual in huge waves of runners but thankfully the corral / wave system seems to work since I was not blocked for extended periods of time and I don't think it really impacted my speed in a considerable way.

I believe the course is also a 100% match for the 2018 course, which incorporated some new routes at the tail end of the marathon - though I haven't confirmed this officially. Overall, I felt like the spectator energy level was higher than usual and was present throughout more of the course (maybe due to the course changes last year?). The beer spectators were present again at Sox Park, frantically handing out cups to runners. They were almost immediately followed by a Goose Island 312 station that was also handing out beer. Somehow, beer is becoming a core theme of the Chicago Marathon.

Overall, I put this year's marathon in the top 5 Chicago's that I've completed. I don't often set a time goal for this marathon because I like to take in the experience of running the course, but this year became a rewarding mix of both. I suspect that next year might be another goal setting marathon. I was around mile 23 or 24 when a thought took hold. 

> If I finish in under 4 hours, that will be a bigger time improvement from 2018 than a PR would be from 2019 to 2020.

I'll see how good of an idea that seems in a few months.
