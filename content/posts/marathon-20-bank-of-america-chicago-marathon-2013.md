I never thought that after 19 marathons I would still be nervous, anxious, and getting goosebumps at the starting corral in Chicago.

There was something about Chicago that wasn't present in any of the other marathons that I finished this year. The other marathons were 26.2 mile runs and I hoped for a good time. Chicago this year was a race.

> PR or die.

Getting a good time wasn't optional it was a requirement. Being with 40,000+ runners this year pushed me to leave nothing on the course. I'm happy to say (my legs, not so much) that I was able to execute my best marathon performance this year.

I didn't have a set game-plan until after the race had started and I was around mile three. I didn't feel 100% after Fox Valley and still hadn't answered the question: "Do I want to enjoy the Chicago Marathon, or do I want to hate every second of it and run for a PR?". I started the race aiming to keep myself in a good position in-case I decided to take off. Just before mile four, I gave myself the green light.

My race preparation wasn't too much different than usual. Moderate carb-loading the day before with lots of hydration. I picked up my race packet and made sure my gear was in order the night before.

I arrived in Grant Park around 6 a.m. for the 7:30 start. A noticeable increase in race security was immediately apparent. Garbage cans were scarce, required security checks on all gear bags and policemen everywhere. Plow trucks and cement barricades were present at all major entry ways to the park. No one was going to be there who didn't belong. As far as I know (I was there pretty early) this didn't cause too much of a commotion with runners getting to their assigned corrals, nor did it detract from the gorgeous weather that we had in store for the race.

I think all of these precautions, coupled with a moment of silence for Boston, made for one of the most memorable moments I have experienced before any race. When they had the singing of the national anthem, the loud-speakers kept cutting out for a couple seconds and you could hear all the runners singing the anthem without any pause. I'm sure everyone went out the gate faster than planned.

I failed to find my Garmin the night before in order to keep an eye on my pace and figured I was going to find a pace group to hold on to. Fortunately, in B corral there was a 3:35:00 pace group that would have put me within shooting range of my PR. I filed in behind them but stay with them long because the group was basically the width of the entire street and had too many people in it to run comfortably. The strategy changed from "pace group" to "run like hell".

> If there's any course that I know well, it's Chicago. 

I know where every aid station is, every turn before I see it, and I know where the crowd is going to be at its thinnest and its thickest. I used to think these things didn't really matter, but this year it helped me considerably. I had gels ready before the aid stations, I knew when to pull back on the speed when going into a high energy area, and how long I would have to hold on through the deserted areas. 

In my opinion, the course is great until mile 18. Crowds are energetic before 18 with a few relatively quiet areas, but nothing vacant. The temperature stays cool and I usually feel strong well after the half-way point. This trend continued this year, and aside from a rest stop around mile 6, I was well on PR pace. I progressed from the 3:35 pace group to 3:20 and was still feeling good at mile 17.

Until mile 17 I had the same thought in my head. "You are in for a world of hurt later". At 17 I started to pay for the speed. 

As much as I love the Chicago course, it can have a difficult third act. When you're down in Pilsen and near Sox park, streets are thin of spectators, without shade, and you're heading in the opposite direction of the finish line. It isn't until mile 23 that you start making the seemingly endless crawl up Michigan back to Grant Park. During this struggle I made a goal to "just get to Michigan"_._ By the time I reached Michigan Ave my 7:50ish minute miles had fallen to 8:30 minute miles.

Right around mile 25 I saw on the clock "3:22" and realized I had to run one hell of a mile +.2 on a cramping set of legs if I was going to have a shot at a PR. Fortunately, the discomfort was isolated to my right knee and calf. I wasn't dehydrated or nauseous so I could still push the pace.

3:28 was the goal. I _thought_ it took me around 2 minutes to get across the starting line at the beginning of the race so I was looking for 3:30 when I crossed. I crossed after 3:31. Disappointed.

My PRs have been a tricky thing. Starting in 2009, it took me two years to hit my PR plateau and I haven't really budged since. In 2011 I ran a 3:34 at the Christie Clinic Marathon in Champaign. Later that year, I tried running Chicago with a Boston qualifying pace as long as I could, managing to complete \~8 miles with a 6:50 average pace. Later I collapsed, resulting in a still respectable 3:32 marathon. Then there was the United States Air Force Marathon in September 2012. I was in peak shape for that race and haven't been that fast again. On a hilly marathon course my Garmin clocked me with a 3:28:58 marathon time. My official Chicago Marathon 2013 time? 3:29:34. 36 seconds away.

This was too close for me to trust my "unofficial" Garmin USAF time so I looked up my old results. My official registered USAF Marathon time is 3:29:43. I officially PR'd Sunday by 9 seconds. 9 SECONDS.

This was my favorite Chicago Marathon of the five years I've done it. I've had more fun running this course in other years, but almost everything about this marathon worked out. The weather was great, the crowds were superb as usual, and it was a fast race. I probably shouldn't have pressed as hard as I did, having missed some training in previous weeks. My recovery is pretty bad right now, but PR'ing is great (even if your previous PR ended up being a lie). Based on how fast this race has been filling up I'm expecting that this may be my last shot at it. Sad, but if there's a way to go out, PR'ing on my 20th total marathon is fine by me. If you told me in 2009 that I would be running my 20th total marathon just 4 years later, I would have called you crazy.
