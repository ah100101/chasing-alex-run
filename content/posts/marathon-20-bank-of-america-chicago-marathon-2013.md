You would think that, after 19 marathons, I wouldn't be nervous, anxious, and getting goosebumps in the starting corral before Chicago. But there I was feeling like it was marathon number one.

[![Ready to go](http://alexalwaysrunning.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/wp_20131013_002.jpg?w=640 =640x360)](http://alexalwaysrunning.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/wp_20131013_002.jpg)There was something about Chicago that wasn't present in any of the other marathons that I have finished this year. The other marathons were 26.2 mile runs and I hoped for a good time. Chicago this year was a race. PR or die. Getting a good time wasn't an option, it was required. Being with 40,000+ runners makes you want to perform at your very best and leave nothing on the course by the time you cross the finish line. I'm happy to say (my legs are not happy to say) that I was able to show up with my best marathon performance this year.

I actually didn't have a set game-plan until after the race had started and I was around mile three. I still didn't feel quite 100% after Fox Valley and still hadn't answered the question: "Do I want to enjoy the Chicago Marathon? Or do I want to hate every second of it and try for a PR?". I started the race aiming to keep myself in a good position in-case I decided to take off. Just before mile four, I gave myself the green light to take off.

My race preparation wasn't too much different than usual. Moderate carb-loading the day before with lots of hydration. I picked up my race packet and made sure my gear was in order the night before. Nothing different there.

[![Road gear](http://alexalwaysrunning.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/wp_20131012_005.jpg?w=169 =169x300)](http://alexalwaysrunning.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/wp_20131012_005.jpg)I arrived in Grant Park around 6 am for the 7:30 start. A noticeable increase in race security was immediately apparent. Garbage cans were scarce, required security checks on all gear bags, and policemen everywhere. Plow trucks and cement barricades were present at all major entry ways to the park. No one was going to be there that wasn't supposed to be there. As far as I know (I was there pretty early) this didn't cause too much of a commotion with runners getting to their assigned corrals, nor did it detract from the gorgeous weather that we had in store for the race. Energy was high.

I think all of these precautions, coupled with a moment of silence for Boston, made for one of the most memorable moments I have experienced at any race. When they had the singing of the national anthem, the loud-speakers kept cutting out for a couple seconds. But what could have ruined the anthem, actually enhanced because all the runners (and I'm assuming any non-runners) proceeded to sing the anthem without any pause from the speakers dying out. I'm sure everyone went out the starting gate too fast after that.

Race start was soon after. I had looked the night before for my Garmin watch in order to keep tabs on my pace so I could shoot for a PR. But that was a fail and figured I was going to find a pace group and hold on for my life. Fortunately, in B corral there was a 3:35:00 pace group that would have put me within shooting range of my PR. I filed in behind them. This didn't last long at all because the pace group was basically the width of the entire street and had way too many people in it to run comfortably. Due to claustrophobia, the strategy quickly changed from "pace group" to "running like hell and hope a PR follows".

If there's any course that I know well, it's Chicago. I know where every aid station is before I get there, every turn before I see it, and I know where the crowd is going to be at its thinnest and its thickest. I used to think these things didn't really matter, but this year it helped me considerably. I had gels ready before the aid stations, I knew when to pull back on the speed when going into a high energy area, and how long I would have to hold on through the deserted areas. The course is at its best, in my opinion, all the way until mile 18. For the most part, crowds are thick and energetic before 18. There are a couple quiet areas, but nothing vacant. If you're moving fast enough the temperature is still cool. Everything was functioning great, and aside from a rest stop around mile 6, I was well on PR pace. I had progressed from the 3:35 pace group to 3:20 and was still feeling good at mile 17.

Up until mile 17 I had the same thought echoing in my head. "You are in for a world of hurt later". At 17 this changed to "You asked for this". As much as I love the Chicago course, it has a tragic second half. When you're down in Pilsen and near Sox park, streets are thin of spectators, without shade, and you're heading in the opposite direction of the finish line. It isn't until around mile 23, that you start making the seemingly endless crawl up Michigan back to Grant Park. Another frequent thought was definitely "Just make to Michigan".

By the time I reached Michigan my 7:50ish minute miles had fallen to 8:30 minute miles. It had gotten ugly.

Right around mile 25 I looked at the clock, saw "3:22" and realized I was going to have to run one hell of a mile +.2 on a cramping set of legs if I was going to have a shot at a PR. If there was anything good about how I was feeling at that moment, it was that at least all the pain was confined to my right calf, right knee, and right hamstring. I wasn't dehydrated or nauseous, I just had to make sure that every time my right leg ceased for a moment, that I didn't fall flat on my face.

3:28 was the goal. It took me around 2 minutes (wasn't quite sure) to get across the starting line at the beginning of the race so I was looking for 3:30 when I crossed. I crossed after 3:31. Bummer.

But my PRs have been a tricky thing. Starting in 2009, it took me two years to hit my PR plateau and I haven't budged since. Back in 2011 I ran a 3:34 at the Christie Clinic Marathon in Champaign. Later that year, I tried running Chicago with a Boston qualifying pace as long as I could, managing to complete \~8 miles with a 6:50 average pace. Later I collapsed, resulting in a still respectable 3:32 marathon. Then there was the United States Air Force Marathon in September 2012. I was in peak shape for that race. I have never been that fast again. On a hilly marathon course my Garmin clocked me with a 3:28:58 marathon time. My official Chicago Marathon 2013 time? 3:29:34. 36 seconds away.

This was too close for me to trust my "unofficial" Garmin USAF time so I looked up my old results. My official registered USAF Marathon time is 3:29:43. I officially PR'd Sunday by 9 seconds. 9 SECONDS.

Don't buy Garmin.

This was my favorite Chicago Marathon of the five years that I have done it. I've had more fun running this course in other years, but everything about this marathon worked out. The weather was great, the crowds were superb as usual, and it was a fast race. I probably shouldn't have pressed as hard as I did, having missed some training in previous weeks. My recovery is pretty bad right now, but PR'ing is good stuff (even if your previous PR ended up being a lie). Based on how fast this race has been filling up I'm expecting that this may be my last shot at it. Sad, but if there's a way to go out, PR'ing on my 20th total marathon is fine by me. If you told me in 2009 that I would be running my 20th total marathon just 4 years later, I would have called you crazy.
