### Previous Experiences

This year will be my 11th Chicago Marathon and my 27th overall marathon. The Christie Clinic Marathon and the Chicago Marathon are the only marathons that I have done more than once. The energy during the race is through the roof from spectators lining almost the entire course. The most difficult portion of the race, in my opinion, is between miles 21 to 23. The crowds around Sox Park are thin, but I've learned a trick over the last few years to help get me down there. There is almost always a group of spectators on the north side of 33rd St. (when you turn left at the stadium) handing out Dixie cups of beer.

I ran my best marathon at Chicago in 2013 with a PR of 3:29:34. My slowest Chicago was my first in 2009 with 4:57:55 where I had an inflamed IT band, but you wouldn't know it if you saw me at the finish.

Temperature in early October can be difficult to plan around. 2010 was one of the hottest years I ran it where nausea from dehydration is the largest hurdle in the last 6 miles. If you leave out 2010, all the other years have been ranged between 40°F - 70°F. 

There are a few portions of the course that I find myself looking for when the run is tough and I'm trying to find a carrot to run for.

* China Town has a surge of spectator energy following a relative lull for a few miles prior.
* The previously mentioned _Beer People_
* The final stretch on Michigan Ave is nearly two miles long but typically also high energy while you grind out the last few miles.
* The turn from Michigan onto Roosevelt Road is probably one of the loudest sections on the course, which is great because Roosevelt is brutal to climb before turning to see the finish line.

### Race Plan

Unless a miracle happens there isn't really a chance of me PRing this year. However, I do plan on getting under 4 hours for the first time since 2013. There are a couple strategies I hope to follow to accomplish this.

* Run the first half of the race slower than the second. My absolute slowest pace I want is 9 min/mile. For the first 13.1 miles I hope to stick around that pace then step on the gas a bit more after.
* Not rely on GPS. I have been training with a Garmin and city running is not dependable for a GPS based watch. I'll be checking my splits through the race. At my slowest I should be hitting the following splits:

  3 miles: 27:00

  6 miles: 54:00

  9 miles: 1:21:00

  12 miles: 1:48:00

  Half Marathon: 1:57:00

  16 miles: 2:24:00

  19 miles: 2:51:00

  22 miles: 3:18:00

  25 miles: 3:45:00

  Marathon: 3:55:58
* In previous years I estimated how fast I could by how I generally felt. Assuming that my legs are feeling normal (or as normal as they can feel) I will be going off my heart rate for my pace. I will be trying to stay in the 130 - 150 BPM. I set this ranged based on the half marathon I finished in September that was at a similar pace.

Almost every year I had a "plan" something happens to partially derail and then I'm troubleshooting on the fly. I've learned that any good mile after 18 is a gift so I'll be hoping to string together as many as possible.
