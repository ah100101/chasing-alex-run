Some visitors may remember that in 2013 I had a running blog documenting my attempt at running 13 marathons in a year (#RIP 13 in 13 Wordpress blog). I have carried over [two](https://chasingalex.run/posts/marathon-20-bank-of-america-chicago-marathon-2013/ "Chicago Marathon 2013") of my [favorite](https://chasingalex.run/posts/big-sur-marathon-2013-recap/ "Big Sur Marathon") marathons from that blog into this site.

I plan on using this site in a similar way for documenting endurance events and also as a way to discuss the topics revolving around them. For more details on myself, this site and how it was built check out the [about](https://chasingalex.run/about/ "About") page.

Most updates will obvious appear on the [Home](https://chasingalex.run/ "Home") and [Posts](https://chasingalex.run/posts/ "Posts") pages and be sure to check out the [Roadmap](https://chasingalex.run/roadmap/ "Roadmap") page for a full timeline of all my major events.
