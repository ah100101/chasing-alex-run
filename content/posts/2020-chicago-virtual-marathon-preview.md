All of the runners that signed up for the 2020 Chicago Marathon were not expecting this. Chicago announced its switch to a virtual marathon a few months back and it's still odd to think that this will be the first year in over ten that I won't be lining up at the starting line in Grant Park with over 30,000 runners. 

I'm still amped for this race.

Right before the Africa trip I decided to pull the trigger on getting the coach with the goal of hitting a PR in Chicago this year. For a few weeks I was worried that the global pandemic was going to suck the motivation and desire for this PR out of my training, but I found the opposite happened. The additional accountability and training plan provided a great distraction and focal point for the last seven months. Thanks to [Coach Ed](https://run4prs.co/coach-ed/ "Coach Ed") from [Run4PRs](https://run4prs.co/ "Run4PRs") and a _ton_ of running volume this year, I'm happy to say that I'm walking into this race with a PR being a realistic possibility.

To put this into perspective, last year I ran a 3:52:44 marathon at a 8:41 min / mile average pace. I started training in July for the 2019 marathon and recorded around 419 miles total before race day. I started training this year in January and logged over 1,250 miles total. The goal this year is to hit a 3:25:00 marathon and average around a 7:49 min / mile average pace. I hope to accomplish this by hitting gradually increasing mile times, starting at an 8:05 min / mile pace at the start.

Deciding where to run this virtual marathon has been a bit tricky. I initially wanted to run it on the lakefront, but getting water and aid out there was going to be a headache. I ran my 20 miler out on the Illinois Prairie Path, having ran hundreds of miles on that trail a few years back, but the gravel and dirt situation seemed less than ideal for a PR attempt. As a result, I'm going as far away from "scenic" as possible and am going to run the 26.2 miles on a quarter mile track in the nearby neighborhood. Running on a track will be boring for some portions, but it gives me very few excuses for not running a super smart race. I should be able to closely watch my mile and lap pace and will always have food and water nearby as I progress through the distance.

I have actually ran a track marathon before and it isn't _as bad_ as you might expect. Knowing that anything can happen after mile 20, I'm hopeful that my training and the course will enable me to stick closely to the game plan.
